            <h4 id="paragraph">A school cannot buy its spirit as it buys textbooks, nor can it have this spirit supplied as basic equipment. School spirit is built up within the school itself. The first leaders of the school and the first students play a vital important part in so organising their actions, thoughts and aspirations that a school spirit emerges. What are you contributing? Will the school be better for your being here or will you set a pattern that causes certain restrictions to be imposed on your fellow students, now and possibly for a long time? Your school is a good school. It enjoys a good reputation in your community. Velammal Global School is ranked as one of the top International IGCSE Schools In Chennai, India.

            <h4 id="paragraph">The teachers of Primary school provide a warm and welcoming place to learn and grow, focusing on the all-round development of the child, ensuring their well-being while nurturing natural curiosity, creativity thus laying the solid foundation for future learning experiences. In these formative years ample opportunities are provided so as to enable children to meet the demands of life with self-confidence and assurance. Through various social interactions and moral teachings, good and high values like truth, sympathy, love and co-operation are cultivated in children. In addition to academics, a number of co-curricular activities like  Science quiz, Maths wizard and many more are held on a regular basis for the integrated development of the personality of each and every child. Sports activities like gymnastics, skating, chess and horse riding at the Primary School help the children learn many skills such as team work and composure apart from building their self-esteem, character and confidence.

All the children are enlightened and empowered with knowledge and perfection
before they step into the Middle school.</h4>

Sport develops a sense of friendliness among the children and develops their team spirit. It helps children to develop their values, mental and physical toughness. Sport shapes their body and makes it strong and active. VGSP believes in fostering a culture of excellence and reaching the highest possible level of achievement. To inculcate the above, we celebrated the 4th Champion’s day on 02.02.2019 (Saturday).</h4>
